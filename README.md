Rezzy
=====

Modern (unfinished) resume builder written in React

**Note**: This repo only contains front-end code.

Upcoming Features
-----------------

- [x] Color themes in resume viewer
- [ ] Drag-n-drop resume builder that uses `react-materialize` components (could be a library of it's own)
- [ ] Generate and share private links to rezzy

Long-term goals
---------------

- [ ] User dashboard to manage different resumes and manage visibility
- [ ] User accounts/auth with ORM for DB
- [ ] Landing page
- [ ] Control panel
- [ ] Modular auth, dash, and rezzy viewing components that aren't tightly coupled
- [ ] Profit with tech-related ads, not interest-based, and no trackers
- [ ] Let users sign up their resumes for companies to see them (this would involve a different type of user and different control panel altogether)
